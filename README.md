# Trie Implementation in C

This repository contains a simple implementation of a Trie (prefix tree) data structure from scratch in the C programming language.

## Features

- Insert words into the Trie.
- Search for words in the Trie.
- Delete words from the Trie.
- Efficient prefix-based operations.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ouerghi01/trie.git
    cd trie
    ```



3. Run the program And Compile the code:
    ```bash
    chmod +x run.sh
    ./run.sh
    ```
    ```bash
    ./run.sh
    ```

## File Structure

- `trie.c`: Contains the implementation of the Trie data structure.
- `LICENSE`: License information for the repository.
- `test.c`: Contains the test cases for the Trie operations.
- `trie.h`: Header file for the Trie implementation.
-  `run.sh`: Script to compile and run the code.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the repository.

## Usage

Modify the `main` function in `test.c` to test the Trie operations with your own input.
